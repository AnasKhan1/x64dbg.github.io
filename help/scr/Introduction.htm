<P><STRONG>Introduction</STRONG><BR>This is a x64/x32 debugger that is currently 
in active development.</P>
<P>The debugger (currently) has three parts:<BR>- DBG<BR>- 
GUI<BR>        
 - Bridge</P>
<P>DBG is the debugging part of the debugger. It handles 
debugging (using<BR>   TitanEngine) and will provide data 
for the GUI.</P>
<P>GUI is the graphical part of the debugger. It is built 
on top of Qt and it<BR>        provides 
the user interaction.</P>
<P>Bridge is the communication library for the DBG and GUI 
part (and maybe in<BR>the future more parts). The bridge can be used to work on 
new features,<BR> without having to update the code of 
the other parts.</P></head>
